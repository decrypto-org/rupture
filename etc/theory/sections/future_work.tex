\section{Future work}

Rupture demonstrated very positive results against block ciphers in a basic
scenario. The next step is investigating its performance against noisy endpoints
and real-world systems, bypassing issues of compression with irrelevant content
pieces, and testing different AES modes and other encryption algorithms. There
is also a need for a formal proof of CTX's security based on the given lemmas.
